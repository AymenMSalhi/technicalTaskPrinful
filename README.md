I did all the work within the App.vue,
first of all within the init function created() I get the tests so that I can display it in the select input. and if the user dont enter his/her name or dont choose a test, an error message displayed

after the user start the selected test, click start button trigger the get questions and answers APIs,


user can't move to the next question just when answer the current question,  and click the next button calculate always the progress
